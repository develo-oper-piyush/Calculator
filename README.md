## 📟 Calculator

Created by **Piyush** as a project for learning DOM in JS.

A lightweight, responsive calculator using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and vanilla **JavaScript**, showcasing basic DOM manipulation: query selectors, event listeners, and updating `textContent`. Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and clear/reset—without external JS libraries.
